# 🎯 IP & Stream Name Collection - COMPLETE!

## ✅ **Enhanced for Your Example**

From your log message:
```
http error code=404 for url='http://38.46.143.164:8081/stream/cinecanal/playlist.m3u8'
```

**Now Extracts:**
- ✅ **IP Address**: `38.46.143.164` (from URL)
- ✅ **Stream Name**: `cinecanal` (from URL path)
- ✅ **Error Code**: `404`
- ✅ **Full URL**: Complete URL for debugging

## 🔧 **What I Enhanced:**

### `nimble_app_log_parser.py`:
- ✅ **New IP extraction pattern**: `url_ip` regex to capture IP addresses from URLs
- ✅ **Enhanced stream detection**: `stream_url_with_ip` pattern to capture both IP and stream name
- ✅ **Updated `extract_url_details()`**: Now extracts `server_ip` and `stream_name`
- ✅ **Enhanced analysis**: Server IP statistics, stream usage, and server:stream combinations

### `web_gui.py`:
- ✅ **New analysis sections**:
  - 🖥️ **Server IP Analysis**: Top server IPs with request counts
  - 🎬 **Stream Analysis**: Top streams with usage statistics  
  - 🔗 **Server:Stream Combinations**: Shows which IPs serve which streams
  - ⚠️ **Enhanced Error Analysis**: Shows problematic IPs and streams
  - 📋 **Improved Sample Messages**: Displays IP and stream for each error
